# GarrettP_Django_Backend

## Project Description

This Django Project makes up the frontend of my personal porfolio website [garrettpascoe.com](https://garrettpascoe.com/).
You can find the connected frontend in the repository named GarrettP_React_Frontend.

- The DjangoProject folder is the main project directory. It contains the settings.py file,
  which is used for testing the backend locally, and the settings_production.py file, which
  is used when the repository is pushed to the Microsoft Azure web app.

- The DjangoApp folder is the web app directory. It contains the forms, models, and views of
  my website's backend. It also contains the machine learning models that will be used to process
  user entered inputs so that visitors may test their ability to make predictions.
